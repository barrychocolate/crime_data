    "Before using the data, it’s important to review the [changelog](https://data.police.uk/changelog/) on DATA.POLICE.UK, which lists known issues. Understanding these issues is crucial for assessing the reliability and limitations of the data, as certain discrepancies or data gaps could impact the analysis and results.\n",

    "* Avon and Somerset Constabulary: Due to a change in IT systems there are known issues with crime and outcome data since October 2015 as latitude and longitude information is missing from approximately 2000 crimes each month. The force will be working to rectify this and provide the missing data over the coming months.\n",
    "* British Transport Police: ASB data has not been provided for period April 2016 onwards. The force will rectify this issue and provide the missing data over the coming months.\n",
    "Devon and Cornwall: Due to a range of issues, including the implementation of a new record management system in November 2022, outcomes data is unreliable. Work is ongoing to address the issues.\n",
    "* Greater Manchester Police: Due to a change in IT systems no crime, outcome or stop and search data is available from July 2019 onwards. The force are working to rectify this issue and provide the missing data over the coming months.\n",
    "* Gwent Police: The force are currently rectifying the issues with the Stop and Search Data and are looking to provide the data once the issues are rectified.\n",
    "* Humberside Police: The force are implementing a new crime recording system so are currently unable to provide stop and search data. Data will be provided when this work is complete.\n",
